based on the project already done on esp32:

the extend functions should be like this:

1. the camera can take pics(videos) when i send commands and store the videos or pics into the sd card, 
by sending the commands, to tell if the videos needed to the send to the computer or not, if i want, then 
send the pics or videos into my computer or phone.

2. show some pics in the ips screen like the pics that the camera shoot.

3. add some more application into esp32, like iphone info notify(ble), tell the weather info if i want

4. design new pcb with voice recognization and realize the game or applications switch.
