This is where no error is reported, but the image cannot be displayed. The logic is executable.
This is similar to the code of gif_image_load and internal c_array, the former does not print images, but the latter does, after modifying the former accordingly.
But it is not very clear where the reason is, it just works after removing the file system, network system and sd. I guess it is possible that there is a problem with the corresponding configuration in the former that causes the image not to load.
For example, the value of some part of the configuration is enabled or disable, etc.
The end result is: the backlight configuration is not displaying except for the problem, and now the BLE control is relatively ok.
