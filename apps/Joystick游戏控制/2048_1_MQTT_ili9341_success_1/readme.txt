Here is the final effect seen by the original BLE after coding its own game figures for implantation.

Objectives:

1 Add photos and be able to make them switch and enter the game state (in animated form) or in the form of a motion picture by command
2 Show a new picture after the end of the game to complete the goal, indicating a hint for the next puzzle
3 Save the current state of the sudden power failure, so that after the power supply again can directly enter the original state
